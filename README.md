Java implentation of the $1 algorithm, a simple gesture recognition algorithm, that I made for a HCI calss.

Running execute.java will pull up a canvas where gestures can be drawn and recognize and new templates can be added.

The code is a bit sloppy since I was kind of learning how to use Java swing at the time but I plan on cleaning it up a bit soon.
